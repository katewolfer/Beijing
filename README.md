# Beijing data analysis package

This repository holds the functions and data visualisations developed for our ACP paper, implemented in R.  

The functions cover a range of standard univariate and multivariate data analysis, with the data plotting as we used for the paper.

Most of the functions available here can be used for similar datasets. We will make the package fully generalisable as soon as we can.  
In the meantime, the code should work with the dummy dataset contained in the package.  

Some of the functions include:  
- univariate statistics: Spearman correlations and p-values, in a handy text output  
- multivariate statistics: principal components analysis (currently without cross-validation), plus scores and loadings plots  
- correlation heatmaps per assay and per season  


If you find any of the code useful or have suggestions for improvement, please let us know!
