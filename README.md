# Beijing dataset analysis and visualisations
This repository holds the functions and data visualisations developed for our ACP paper, implemented in R.  

The functions cover a range of standard univariate and multivariate data analysis, with the data plotting as used for all paper figures.

Most of the functions available here can be used for similar datasets; some hard coding is present, and we will make the package fully generalisable as soon as we can.

Package dependencies can be found [here](https://github.com/katewolfer/Beijing/blob/main/R/beijingPackages.R), our credit and thanks to the authors of these!

Some of the functions include:  
- univariate statistics: Spearman correlations and p-values, in a handy text output  
  
- multivariate statistics: principal components analysis (currently without cross-validation), plus scores and loadings plots. These plots can also be used for PLSR models, which can be constructed using the [pls](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/pls/index.html) package (also in R).

- correlation heatmaps per assay and per season
